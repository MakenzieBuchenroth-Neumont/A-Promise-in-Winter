Eflyn: You're late, Emberlyn. Was there trouble?
Emberlyn: [sprite=1]No more than usual. The Empire is cracking down on who comes and goes into the Capital City. They are posting more guards at the usual entrances to the market. The Azax saw me, though. They are probably riding through the forest right now.
Eflyn: Well, they dont know how to get through the seal. They didnt see you come in, did they?
